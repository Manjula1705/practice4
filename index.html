        <h1> Demonitisation Merits  </h1>
        <p1>Demonetisation can result in a decrease in tax evasion by individuals and ensure the implementation of practical public measures.
            Tax Collection: Money deposited in the bank during demonetization can be taxed especially if the affected parties were trying to 
            evade taxation by keeping hard cash.
            Growth in a countryâ€™s GDP: Due to low lending rates, improved revenue collection, and growth in savings and deposits
        </p1>
        <h1>Demonitisation Demerits</h1>
        <p2>Every ATM in the country needs to be remodified to allow the exchange of currency.
            Panic: Not everyone understands the essence of demonetization. 
            Slowdown in Economic Growth: Economic growth will experience a period of lull due to business disruptions.
           Disruption of Trade: The normal trading activities may be disrupted by this process since it takes time for consumers and suppliers.
